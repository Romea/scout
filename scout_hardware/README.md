This package provides a hardware interface compatible with the ROS2 Control framework for Scout robots. Once loaded by the Controller Manager, it allows low-level command execution on the robot and enables odometry feedback. For more information on how ROS2 Control works, please refer to the official ROS2 Control documentation.
